## Project Information
Our web chat server project utilizes Java Web Application technology with WebSockets for real-time messaging and HTML/JS/CSS for a user-friendly interface. Users can easily join existing chat rooms or create new ones, engaging in seamless conversations. Each room has its own interface where users can exchange messages instantly. Additionally, our application features an "about" page providing information about the project and its contributors. We aim to create a simple and accessible platform for users to connect and communicate effortlessly.
